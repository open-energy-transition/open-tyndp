Open-TYNDP is a research and innovation project created by `Open Energy Transition (OET) <https://www.openenergytransition.org/>`__.
It is an open-source soft-fork of `PyPSA-Eur <https://github.com/pypsa/pypsa-eur>`__, extended with custom source code, documentation, data and configuration.

The licensing of the Open-TYNDP project follows a similar approach to PyPSA-Eur and is released under multiple licenses:

* Modified source code is licensed as free software under `MIT <LICENSES/MIT.txt>`__ with attribution to OET and its authors.
* Modifications to the original documentation are licensed under `CC-BY-4.0 <LICENSES/CC-BY-4.0.txt>`__ with attribution to OET and its authors.
* Modifications to the original configuration files are licensed under `CC0-1.0 <LICENSES/CC0-1.0.txt>`__ with attribution to OET and its authors.
* Additional data sources are the TYNDP 2024 Scenarios that are licensed under `CC-BY-4.0 <LICENSES/CC-BY-4.0.txt>`__ by ENTSO-E and ENTSOG (see :doc:`tyndp-2024-bundle`).

The original PyPSA-Eur model is released under multiple licenses:

* All original source code is licensed as free software under `MIT <LICENSES/MIT.txt>`__.
* The documentation is licensed under `CC-BY-4.0 <LICENSES/CC-BY-4.0.txt>`__.
* Configuration files are mostly licensed under `CC0-1.0 <LICENSES/CC0-1.0.txt>`__.
* Data files are licensed under `CC-BY-4.0 <LICENSES/CC-BY-4.0.txt>`__.

For easier licensing, the Open-TYNDP and PyPSA-Eur repositories use `REUSE by the FSFE <https://reuse.software/>`__.
You can find the specific licenses for each file in their SPDX identifiers or in the `REUSE.toml <REUSE.toml>`__ file.

Additionally, different licenses and terms of use also apply to the various input data that are not part of the repository (see :doc:`data_sources`).
