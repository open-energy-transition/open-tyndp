This page contains frequently asked questions about the Open-TYNDP project:

General Questions
==================

**Q: What is Open-TYNDP?**

A: Open-TYNDP is an open-source research and innovation project, which is a collaboration between Open Energy Transition (OET) and ENTSO-E. The project aims to explore the option of a complementary open-source tool in the Ten-Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP) by building a workflow based on PyPSA-Eur. It provides one streamlined tool for the Scenario Building and the Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) of the TYNDP.

**Q: How does Open-TYNDP relate to PyPSA-Eur?**

A: Open-TYNDP is a soft-fork of OET/PyPSA-Eur and contains the entire Open-TYNDP project supported by OET, including code, public available data and documentation. It builds on the open-source ecosystem of PyPSA and PyPSA-Eur.

**Q: Is Open-TYNDP ready for production use?**

A: Open-TYNDP is under active development and is not yet feature-complete. The current development status and general limitations are important to understand before using the model. Please refer to the :doc:`limitations` section for more details.

Technical Questions
===================

**Q: Which operating systems are supported?**

A: The PyPSA-Eur workflow is continuously tested for Linux, macOS and Windows (WSL only).



Using Open-TYNDP: Flexibility and Independence
===============================================

**Q: Can I use Open-TYNDP with my own private data?**

A: Yes, you can use Open-TYNDP with your own private data. The open-source nature of the codebase means you have full flexibility to integrate your proprietary or confidential data without any obligation to make it public.

**Q: Do I need to share my code modifications or developments?**

A: No, there is no obligation to share your code modifications or developments publicly. You can keep your code and development private while still benefiting from updates and improvements in the Open-TYNDP repository. You can update your private codebase based on changes in Open-TYNDP at your own pace.

**Q: Am I required to contribute my changes back to Open-TYNDP?**

A: No, contributions are welcome but entirely voluntary. You are free to use Open-TYNDP without any obligation to contribute back. However, contributing improvements, bug fixes, or new features helps strengthen the ecosystem and benefits the broader community.

**Q: Can I collaborate with other organisations privately?**

A: Yes, you can collaborate with other organisations privately. There is no obligation to share data or code publicly when working with partners. Independent organisations can develop their own private repositories using the publicly available Open-TYNDP codebase, enabling private collaboration while maintaining interoperability through the shared foundation.

**Q: What are the benefits of the open-source approach?**

A: The open-source approach provides several benefits: full independence in governance and decision-making, flexibility to keep parts of your work private, ability to request support and feature development from other actors in the ecosystem, interoperability with other organisations using the same foundation, and opportunities for co-developing features through partnerships when desired.
