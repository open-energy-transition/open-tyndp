Open TYNDP Scenarios
####################

The modelling for the reference, National Trends (NT), 
and the deviation scenarios, Distributed Energy (DE) and Global Ambition (GA),
differ in terms of assumptions, storyline and method (capacity expansion vs dispatch modelling).

Here we explain these modelling differences and these differences have been implemented into open-tyndp.
We discuss the relevant configuration settings and the implications of these implementation decisions.

Background information can be found in the report from ENTSO-E and ENTSO-G "TYNDP 2024 Scenarios Methdoology Report".
